=head1 SYNOPSIS

Throw non-exception exceptions when you're using die() for flow
control and want C<$@> to appear to be false/empty.

  use Exception::NoException;
  eval {
    die Exception::NoException->new;
  };
  die $@ if $@;

This is most useful when using L<File::Find>C<::find> or similar
callback-using functions. You can wrap your call in an eval and stop
execution by throwing a non-error. When you look at C<$@> to see if
there's a problem, you won't find any.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item Exception::NoException-E<gt>new

This method takes no arguments and returns a new object that acts like
an empty string C<"">.

=item ref

Overloads the built-in function C<ref> and returns C<"">.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over

=item L<File::Find>C<::find>

 use File::Find;
 use Exception::NoException;

 eval {
     find( sub {
         if ( $File::Find::name =~ /something/ ) {
             # do something with the file
             die Exception::NoException->new;
         }
     } );
 };
 die $@ if $@;

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes came up with a problem where an exception
object used an eval block during the C<bool> conversion from
L<overload>. The following snippet caused him hours of grief and it
inspired me to come up with an object where that effect was actually
desired. It also happens to solve a common problem with loops that use
callbacks.

 # Yitzchak's problem:
 eval {
     die SomeObject->new;
 };
 if ( $@ ) {
     # now $@ is empty.
 }
 package SomeObject;
 use overload bool => sub { eval { } };
 sub new { bless [], shift }

To solve Yitzchak's problem, copy $@ ala C<my $e = $@> before
examining it.
